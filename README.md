## Premise

Heading into the Hackathon this semester, I was interested in creating an augmented reality experience which would both lay the groundwork for interesting projects in the future and would be possible to implement within a day. I was not familiar with any particular AR framework and last worked with Google Maps back many years ago, but my endevour ended up fairly successful.

ClosAR is an application for giving directionality to GPS coordinates. Given access to data and a compass, we can plot points on a map and find out where points of interest lie in the real world, but translating that to pointing your finger will take some orientation first. ClosAR bring AR closer to your life by providing an interface that overlays 2D sprites on to 3D physical locations. These sprites virtually rotate around the device as the user turns around and appear as the user is facing the right direction.
